To install the simulator program:
1. Download the program.
2. In terminal, type cd <simulator location>, to make it current directory.
3. Type "make" or "make simulator", quotes for clarity.(I mean type without the quotes)
4. This will make an executable named simulator in your current directory.
5. Now you can execute it with, ./simulator .
6. Good Luck.

NOTE :
